 ***************************************************************
 * This program is part of the source code released for the book
 *  "Linux Kernel Programming" 2E
 *  (c) Author: Kaiwan N Billimoria
 *  Publisher:  Packt
 *  GitHub repository:
 *  https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Linux-Kernel-Programming_2E
 *
 * From: Ch 13 : Kernel Synchronization - Part 2
 ****************************************************************
  * Brief Description:
 * This driver is built upon the LKP Part 2 book's first chapter 'misc' driver here:
 * https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Linux-Kernel-Programming-Part-2/tree/main/ch1/miscdrv_rdwr
 *
 * This code is 'Case 3: Use RCU' of a three case demo, showing some ways to
 * use locking/sync constructs in a read-mostly scenario.
 * (It's like this:
 *      Case 1                 Case 2                  Case 3
 * No locks; just wrong    Use the read-writer     Use RCU sync!
 *                          spinlock                  Best.
 *                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 *                                                <this code demo>
 *
 * The demo has reader and writer threads running, concurrently reading
 * and writing a global data structure, IOW, shared state.
 * This of course constitutes a critical section(s); if we leave it be,
 * we'll end up with data races, data corruption.
 * So, here, we protect via RCU as follows:
 * - Protect the RCU read-side critical section via RCU 'locking'
 * - Protect the write-side critical section via a simple spinlock.
 *
 * For details, please refer both books, LKP 2E Ch 13 and LKP-Part 2, Ch 1.
